## Week 8 - Challenge

## Series

Here you have an HTML and CSS application. This is an application that manages a list of series, separating them between watched and unwatched series.

This application will be fed from a JS object that you have in the `series.js` file.

You have to display a list of series, separating them into watched and unwatched. Each series has to show all the information you see in the layout. If the series is unwatched, its stars should be set to 0 and the user should be able to click to rate the series with as many stars as necessary. By clicking on a star, the application should modify the rating and the series should be changed from unseen to seen (there is no way to change a series from seen to unseen).

If the user clicks on the x icon, the series should be deleted.
